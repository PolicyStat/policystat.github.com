This is the technical blog for PolicyStat. We make a web-based tool to help
hospitals with their [policy and procedure management](http://www.policystat.com). 
Focusing on a specific task helps us keep our application simple and easy to
use from small doctor's offices to huge multi-layered health systems. We hate
bloated document management systems.

Our application is written in Python and Django and we love open source. Many
of the projects at [Wes'](http://github.com/winhamwr) and
[Christian's](http://github.com/christian-oudard) github pages come via
PolicyStat.
